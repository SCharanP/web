         <h1>Addendum</h1>
    <p>The Lights Out game was originally created by Tiger Electronics in 1995. It is a puzzle game where the goal is to switch off all the lights on a board of lights. Each light has two states: on and off. Clicking on a light toggles its state and the state of its adjacent lights (up, down, left, right). The game is known for its challenging yet addictive gameplay.</p>
    <p>Key game development steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Game Mechanics:</b> Each click toggles the clicked light and its immediate neighbors, which requires strategy and planning to solve the puzzle.</li>
        <li><b>Solvable Setup:</b> Randomly toggling lights on the board ensures a solvable starting point for players.</li>
        <li><b>User Experience:</b> The game design emphasizes clarity and simplicity, allowing players to focus on the puzzle.</li>
        <li><b>Feedback and Sound:</b> Visual and auditory feedback provide satisfying interactions for players.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy playing the Lights Out game! Practice solving puzzles and improve your strategy to tackle increasingly difficult boards.</p>
